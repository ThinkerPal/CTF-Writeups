# Cyber Youth Summit CTF 2021

## Team Info:
- Name: thanks for carry
- Points: 2300
- Standing: 12/83

## How the CTF went:
This was a pretty interesting CTF, given that the challenges were entirely online, isolated from the public facing internet. Difficulty wise, this was quite manageable for the novice that I am. It also covered some pretty obscure categories for CTFs, like on the AWS CLI, DevOps pipeline and a lot of Wifi - alllll the Wifis

Something weird during this CTF was that there was no point decay in the scoring, but I'm not complaining :)

I also had a mid year General Paper exam (I'm taking A-levels next year) when this competition started, and did not get the chance to start until later in the afternoon, when most of the flags we submitted were already completed

This was a very enjoyable experience, and I would like to thank the organising commitee for their efforts!

## tl;dr of what I Should Improve on :tm:
- Better understanding of using network tools (Wireshark, wifi tools like the `aircrack` suite)
- AWS CLI (Although...I don't forsee myself using this much in other CTFs...still good to know!)

## Flags:
- [Wifi Security](Wifi%20Security)
