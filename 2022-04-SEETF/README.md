## How the CTF went:
Personally, I was pretty busy with organising [another conference](https://buildingblocs.sg/2022) whilst this CTF was ongoing, so I have to thank my following teammates ~~for carrying me~~ while I was being a dead weight :clown:

Fun CTF with fun challenges, except that my brain was too dead to really think properly LMAO.
