# DSO-NUS CTF 2021

## Team Info:
- Name: nesting season
- Points: 11xx (lost to the past)
- Standing: Not in top 80 (Out of 800+)

## How the CTF went:
Well. Where do I start? I'm writing this a few months after it has occurred, so some of the details are a bit fuzzy to me. I do remember that there was only 1 category, and it was open for *anyone* studying in an education institute in Singapore, who are not existing DSO Staff or had previously worked in the organisation of the CTF

Needless to say, this CTF was quite difficult for my team and especially me, who was still pretty green to the more advanced topics in CTFs. In fact, other than the giveaway flag that was worth 1000 points, we only managed to solve **1** flag.

Nevertheless, I am including this CTF as the solution to the challenge we managed to solve here was key to solving one of the [CDDC's](../2021-02-CDDC/Linux%20Rules%20the%20World!/6%20-%20Path%20to%20Win) Linux questions.
